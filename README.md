# student-directory

My student directory ruby file allows one to manage a list of students with other information. 

Currently the height, hobbies and country of birth are all hardcoded. Don't be offended, no one reads them and they aren't stored in files so they will disappear again soon enough. 

## How to use ##

To run the file, use ruby directory.rb

If you want to run it with an existing set of students, use ruby directory.rb students.csv

Anything else may need some additional coding.
